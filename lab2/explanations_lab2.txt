=====================================Part1=====================================
We used the "strings ./target | grep -E '^[A-Za-z0-9_]+$'" command to extract strings
that have one or more characters in the range [A-Za-z0-9_]. To further narrow down
the result, we put '^' and '$' to filter out strings contain characters not in
the range. We put this command into a bash script "create_dictionary.sh" and stored each
line of output to a separate file in the dictionary/ folder to construct the dictionary.

=====================================Part2=====================================
Task1:
We added code to get the length of the file and read the whole file into a string and 
passed the string and length to the ip_parse() function being tested. We also added error 
checking to each File I/O calls to make sure that they works correctly so that the testing 
could focus on the ip_parse() function itself.
Task2:
We first cleared the original checksum as required in calculating the new checksum. Then
we read the IHL field in the IP header to get the length of the header. After having 
them done, we summed up each byte pair and stored in a 32-bit integer. Then, we took
the least 16-bit of the sum and added the deferred carries to the sum. In the end, we took
the one's complement of the 16-bit sum to be the checksum and wrote it back to the buffer.

=====================================Part3=====================================
Task1: 
We added a stream socket to connect to the server which IP address is 127.0.0.1 at port 80. After
connected to the server, we sent the fuzzed ouput "buf" to the server and listen to the response 
of the server and stored it in variable res.

Task2: We modified the http.json which defines the grammar of http. We first modified the version 
of http to be any <integer>.<digit> format. Then, we changed the file path to be with file name 
hello but an extension of either php, html, txt as specified, and also xml or png which appears in 
the input file. We also played with the host IP and port number by changing one of them at a time. 
We tried to write a grammar for the date but it did not seem to benefit the coverage that much. As 
a result, we managed to obtain a coverage of around 7.5%
